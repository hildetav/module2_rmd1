## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and a word in __bold__. 

Here is a word in *italics* and a word in _italics_. 

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commands: 
```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4))
```

Non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast

Numbered list: 

1. List
    a. item a 
    b. item b
        i. subitem i
        ii. subitem ii

Example of a block quote: 

> This is a block quote
> Bla bla 
>
> 1. List within block quote:
> 2. Second line

Example of a nested block quote: 

> > This text is nested.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
