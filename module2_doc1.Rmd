## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and a word in __bold__. 

Here is a word in *italics* and a word in _italics_. 

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commands: 
```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4))
```

Non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast

Numbered list: 

1. List
    a. item a 
    b. item b
        i. subitem i
        ii. subitem ii

Example of a block quote: 

> This is a block quote
> Bla bla 
>
> 1. List within block quote:
> 2. Second line

Example of a nested block quote: 

> > This text is nested.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

plot(pressure)

```

```{r pressure2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Insert tables

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars), 
             caption = "Top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```

## Insert equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$


## Insert images

Here is an image inserted

![sunstar](sunstar.png)

## Insert animated GIF and video

![sunstar gif](sunstar.gif) # werkt alleen voor html
![sunstar video](sunstar.mp4) # werkt alleen voor html

## Insert test with some footnotes

Here is a footnote reference [^1] and another [^2]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inline notes are easier to write since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to write the note]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^2] Here's one with multiple blocks.
